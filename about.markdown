I am a first year MSc/PhD student studying data analytics and society at the University of liverpool.

My project is based on designing resilient coastal cities using big data, working with [Marlan Maritime Technologies](https://marlan-tech.co.uk/).

This website is designed to house my [project portfolio](/myprojects/).
