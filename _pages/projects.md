[<b> GEOG5995 - ASSIGNMENT 1 (BUILDING AN AGENT BASED MODEL)</b>](https://github.com/jammy-data/Practicals)

This is the first project I completed during my PhD. The aim of this assignment was to get me used
to Python commands and functionality, and create an ABM based on sheep roaming around a field.  
<span style="font-size:0.8em; color:gray;">_This project includes loops, functions, multiple agents, animation and GUI._</span>
