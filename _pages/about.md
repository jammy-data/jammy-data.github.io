I am a first year MSc/PhD student studying data analytics and society at the University of liverpool. I am part of the wider ranging [data analytics and society CDT](https://datacdt.org/) which is spread across the University of Manchester, University of Liverpool, University of Sheffield and the University of Leeds.

My project is based on designing resilient coastal cities using big data, working with [Marlan Maritime Technologies](https://marlan-tech.co.uk/).

This website is designed to house my [project portfolio](/myprojects/).
